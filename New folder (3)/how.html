<h1>How we work</h1>
<p>We create advertisments that can be easily adapted by your team to suit your changing needs.

<!--list-->

<ol>
<li>You provide us with the information for what your advertising campaign is about.</li>
<li>We use the information you have given us to create an advetising plan and then we meet with you to see how well it reflects your Company and your advertising ideas.</li>
<li>Together we fine tune your advertising strategy and complete the initial advertisement.</li>
<li>Once the advertisment strategy meets your needs and approval we run the advert on all relevant platforms.</li>
<li>We can train your team to manage the advertisment sites or we can maintain them for you.</li>
<li>Your advertisements can be easily adapted to suit your ongoing needs.</li>
<li>As a client we think of you as part of the HashingAdvertisements family and will make it our responsibility to follow-up with you on a regular to see how we can enable you to make full advantage of all the advertising you require.</li>
